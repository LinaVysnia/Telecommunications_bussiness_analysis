- [X] Create correlation matrix  
- [X] Analyse client behaviour and focus on tendencies for leaving

### Unsupervised Machine Learning (clustering)
- [X] Get the optimal cluster number using KNN
- [ ] Do hierarchical clustering and get a dendrogram

### Supervised Machine Learning (prognosis)
- [ ] Train DT model
- [ ] Train RF model
- [ ] Train SVM model
